    Specification of a File version on Humanloop.

    This can be done in a couple of ways:

    - Specifying `version_id` directly.
    - Specifying a File (and optionally an Environment).
      - A File can be specified by either `path` or `file_id`.
      - An Environment can be specified by `environment_id`. If no Environment is specified, the default Environment is used.
    """

    version_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    Unique identifier for the File Version. If provided, none of the other fields should be specified.
    """

    path: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    Path identifying a File. Provide either this or `file_id` if you want to specify a File.
    """

    file_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    Unique identifier for the File. Provide either this or `path` if you want to specify a File.
    """

    environment: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
    Name of the Environment a Version is deployed to. Only provide this when specifying a File. If not provided (and a File is specified), the default Environment is used.
