    """
    ID of the directory that the file is in on Humanloop.

    template: typing_extensions.NotRequired[AgentResponseTemplateParams]
    """
    The template contains the main structure and instructions for the model, including input variables for dynamic values. 
    
    For chat models, provide the template as a ChatTemplate (a list of messages), e.g. a system message, followed by a user message with an input variable.
    For completion models, provide a prompt template as a string. 
    
    Input variables should be specified with double curly bracket syntax: `{{input_name}}`.

    The template language to use for rendering the template.

    """
    The company providing the underlying model service.

    max_tokens: typing_extensions.NotRequired[int]
    """
    The maximum number of tokens to generate. Provide max_tokens=-1 to dynamically calculate the maximum number of tokens to generate given the length of the prompt
    """

    temperature: typing_extensions.NotRequired[float]
    """
    What sampling temperature to use when making a generation. Higher values means the model will be more creative.

    """
    An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.

    The string (or list of strings) after which the model will stop generating. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

    """
    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the generation so far.

    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on how frequently they appear in the generation so far.

    Other parameter values to be passed to the provider call.
