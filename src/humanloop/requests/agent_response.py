    Path of the Agent, including the name, which is used as a unique identifier.

    """
    ID of the directory that the file is in on Humanloop.

    template: typing_extensions.NotRequired[AgentResponseTemplateParams]
    """
    The template contains the main structure and instructions for the model, including input variables for dynamic values. 
    
    For chat models, provide the template as a ChatTemplate (a list of messages), e.g. a system message, followed by a user message with an input variable.
    For completion models, provide a prompt template as a string. 
    
    Input variables should be specified with double curly bracket syntax: `{{input_name}}`.
    """

    template_language: typing_extensions.NotRequired[TemplateLanguage]
    """
    The template language to use for rendering the template.

    """
    The company providing the underlying model service.
    """

    max_tokens: typing_extensions.NotRequired[int]
    """
    The maximum number of tokens to generate. Provide max_tokens=-1 to dynamically calculate the maximum number of tokens to generate given the length of the prompt
    """

    temperature: typing_extensions.NotRequired[float]
    """
    What sampling temperature to use when making a generation. Higher values means the model will be more creative.
    """

    top_p: typing_extensions.NotRequired[float]
    """
    An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
    """

    stop: typing_extensions.NotRequired[AgentResponseStopParams]
    """
    The string (or list of strings) after which the model will stop generating. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
    """

    presence_penalty: typing_extensions.NotRequired[float]
    """
    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the generation so far.

    Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on how frequently they appear in the generation so far.

    Other parameter values to be passed to the provider call.

    """
    Guidance on how many reasoning tokens it should generate before creating a response to the prompt. OpenAI reasoning models (o1, o3-mini) expect a OpenAIReasoningEffort enum. Anthropic reasoning models expect an integer, which signifies the maximum token budget.

    tools: typing.Sequence["AgentResponseToolsItemParams"]
    """
    List of tools that the Agent can call. These can be linked files or inline tools.
