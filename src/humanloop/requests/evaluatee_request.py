    Specification of a File version on Humanloop.

    This can be done in a couple of ways:

    - Specifying `version_id` directly.
    - Specifying a File (and optionally an Environment).
      - A File can be specified by either `path` or `file_id`.
      - An Environment can be specified by `environment_id`. If no Environment is specified, the default Environment is used.
    """

    version_id: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]

    path: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]

    """

    environment: typing_extensions.NotRequired[str]
    """
