        Log to a Prompt.


        You can use query parameters `version_id`, or `environment`, to target

        an existing version of the Prompt. Otherwise the default deployed
        version will be chosen.


        Instead of targeting an existing version explicitly, you can instead
        pass in

        Prompt details in the request body. In this case, we will check if the
        details correspond

        to an existing version of the Prompt, if not we will create a new
        version. This is helpful

        in the case where you are storing or deriving your Prompt details in

  Prompts define how a large language model behaves.


  #### What is a Prompt?


  A Prompt on Humanloop encapsulates the base instructions and other
  configuration for how a large language model should

  perform a specific task.


  Prompts have immutable versions that you can **Commit** and **Deploy**.

  To use a Prompt, you can **Call** it to create a generation and you can
  **Log** generations manually.


  #### Referencing Prompts


  Prompts are referenced by their unique ID or path.


  You can perform actions on a specific Prompt version by specifying either the
  `version_id`

  or `environment` query parameter in the request. If you provide a
  `version_id`, Humanloop will

  use the specified version of the Prompt. If you provide an `environment`,
  Humanloop will use the

  version of the Prompt that is currently deployed to that Environment.

  If you do not provide either a `version_id` or `environment`, Humanloop will
  use the Prompt version

  that is deployed to the default Environment.
